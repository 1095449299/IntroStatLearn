# ISLR -- Python: Labs and Applied

Python code for Labs and Applied questions from the book: ['Introduction to
Statistical Learning with Applications in
R'](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie and
Tibshirani (2013).

This is a well-written book that provides a thoruough introduction to
statistical learning methods. The book and associated datasets are available on the [authors website](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). In addition,the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) is a fantastic resource for many more publicly available datasets.

Since I use python for data analysis, I decided to rewrite the labs and
answer the applied questions using python and the following packages:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)
* [Patsy](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

The code for each lab or applied question is written in a Jupyter notebook.
For the applied questions, there is **no guarantee** that the solutions are
correct. Suggestions and corrections are welcome.
