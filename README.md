# ISLR -- Python: Labs and Applied

Python code for Labs and Applied questions from the book: ['Introduction to
Statistical Learning with Applications in
R'](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie and
Tibshirani (2013).

This well-written book provides an excellent introduction to statistical learning methods. The algorithms and datasets used in the book are written in R. Since I use python for data analysis, I decided to rewrite the labs and
answer the applied questions using python and the following packages:

[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)<br>
[Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)<br>
[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)<br>
[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)<br>
[Statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)<br>
[Patsy](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)<br>
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

I have also converted the R datasets into csv files. These can be found in
the data directory.

The code for each lab or applied question is written in a Jupyter notebook.
For the applied questions, there is **no guarantee** that the solutions are
correct. Suggestions and corrections are always welcome.
